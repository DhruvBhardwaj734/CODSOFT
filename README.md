Over the course of the past month, I have had the privilege of engaging in a diverse range of stimulating tasks that have not only challenged me, but also facilitated my growth as a developer. Below are some of the projects that I have had the opportunity to work on:

#Number Guessing 🎲

I developed a Java program that enables users to participate in a number guessing game. This involved implementing logic to generate a random number, receive user inputs, and provide feedback based on the guesses. This task significantly enhanced my understanding of conditional statements and user input handling.

#Word Counter 📝

I created a Java program that counts the number of words in a given text file. This entailed utilizing file handling techniques to read the input file and implementing an algorithm to count the words. This project bolstered my file handling skills and introduced me to string manipulation in Java.

#Student Management System 📚

I developed a comprehensive Java application that manages student records. This involved implementing functionalities such as adding, updating, and deleting student information, as well as generating reports. This task enabled me to practice object-oriented programming concepts and reinforced my knowledge of data structures.

#ATM Interface 💳

I designed an interactive ATM interface using Java Swing. This involved implementing features such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, and deposit functions. This project provided me with hands-on experience in GUI development and event handling in Java.
